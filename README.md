# Bamazon Node Application Customer / Manager


Instructions

    * Run this application in command line running either "node bamazonCustomer.js" or "node bamazonManager.js"
    * Each application will present options of what the user can do using inquirer
    * As a Customer, you can purchase products
    * As a manager, you can view all products, view low inventory, add inventory of a product, or add a new product


Project Design

    * This project uses mysql to store and pull all data. Use the seed file to populate your local database
    * I used three different packages: inquirer, mysql, and colors (to give the command line some flavor)
    * Each file has a series of functions that contain specific tasks
    * A switch statement was used for the manager portion to determine which function to use
    * View the gifs below to see different app behavior
